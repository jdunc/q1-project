Idea One
  
   A webpage that lists the next legislation to be vote on in the house / senate.
   Also includes a way to search for legislation by keyword
   Users can comment on the legislation as a whole or highlight specific sections and comment on those words alone
   Users can up or down vote the whole article or particular sections
   Users can add tags to the whole article or specific sections (intended to tag emotional response to section)
   https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/bill?congress=112&order_by=-current_status_date
   https://www.govtrack.us/
   
Idea Two
  I'll use volunteermatch.com as well as people's likes on facebook to try and search for a nearby volunteer opportunity 
  based on peoples Facebook likes (I have existing Facebook api prvileges that allow querying likes and have just applied for volunteermatch's
  api key)
  
Idea Three
  I want to revisit the idea of using alchemy api to analyze text for its emotional content.  I want to analyze news documents and plot them on a map.  I did this before, but it has since broke.  And I want it to function for any location.  Eventually I want people to be able to sort by topic and emotional values.
